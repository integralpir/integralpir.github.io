            CSS-Cascading Style Sheets, a language for describing the appearance of web pages<br>
            has written in the markup languages. The most commonly is HTML.<br>
            The concept of this technology was proposed by Hakon Vium Lie,<br>
            a Norwegian scientist and information technology specialist has worked for the W3C consortium at that time.<br>
            CSS makes the document easy to understand<br>
            and reduces the complexity and repetitiveness in the structural content of the document seriously.
