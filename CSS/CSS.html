            CSS-Cascading Style Sheets,<br>
            a language for describing the appearance of web pages<br>
            written in the aforementioned markup languages, most commonly HTML.<br>
            The concept of this technology was proposed by Hakon Vium Lie,<br>
            a Norwegian scientist and information technology specialist working for the W3C consortium at the time.<br>
            making the document more understandable, manageable and flexible,<br>
            and seriously reducing the complexity and repetitiveness in the structural content of the document.
