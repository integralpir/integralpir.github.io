    <h1>HTML 4.0 & CSS 2</h1>
    <p>
        In 1997, web development drove into a corner <br>
        There were so many possibilities for website development<br>
        and layout that the computers of the time could not cope with the workload.<br>
        Optimising resources to handle the large amount of activity was necessary.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        To address the current issues, a new version of HTML 4.0 has been released.<br>
        This version of the language encouraged users to actively use CSS style sheets<br>
        and get rid of the drawbacks of previous versions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1998, developers received the second version of CSS.<br>
        Extended functionality, with the ability to work with sound, block formatting and paginated styles.<br>
        Its broad functionality and versatility has allowed this version to be relevant for some 20 years.<br>
        Despite the introduction of CSS3, the second version has long been a favourite with developers.
