            That day, computers at four universities<br>
            were linked together in an experimental network called ARPANet.<br>
            "Lo" was the first message transmitted between two machines.<br>
            The creators of the network had planned to pass on the word "Login",<br>
            but due to shortcomings inherent in something new,<br>
            only the first two letters could be passed on.

            Before the 1990s, the Internet was like a messenger:<br>
            user sent a message to a specific IP address and the recipient could read it.<br>
            The blatantly weak functionality of the Internet blocked its spread to the masses,<br>
            the functionality of the Internet could easily be replaced by cheaper counterparts (e.g. telephone calls).
